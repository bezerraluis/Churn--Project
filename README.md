# Business Problem

Decreasing the number of churns is something that the entire company needs to pursue. It is essential for the growth and health of any operation.

How to project growth, attract investors if customer retention fails within organizations.

When a user churns, and this is repeated with other people, a very large alert signal needs to be turned on.

And a question must be answered: what are we doing wrong?

Customers talk to each other. Information is accessible to all. Therefore, working to have an ever lower churn, close to zero, is a tireless pursuit.

More than that. Understanding the (especially financial) impact of this metric is vital. It is what will maintain financial health and a safer hike for any business.

# Business Goal
